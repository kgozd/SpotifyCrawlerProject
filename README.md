This project project is an appliction which conencts with Spotify API and browse artists, albums and songs statitstics.
For best expierience  I recommend to use Python 3.11 *(or higher) version. 

To run application after downloading project from repository you should:

1) create config.py file which consists api keys(struture of the file below): 

    #APi_keys
    
    
    
    
    client_id="<spotify_client_id>"
    client_secret= "<spotify_client_secret>"


2) Run run.py file which automatically detect your python version and install all of needed packeges...






  ...or install all of needed packeges and libraries manually(list of them below):
				matplotlib
				customtkinter
				spotipy
 	 Then run mainview.py or run.py.
			
		
		



*lower version of code will probably also run this app, but it may cause some malfunctions with proper displaying of the app.
